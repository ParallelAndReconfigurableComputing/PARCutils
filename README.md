# PARCutils

PARCutils is an ongoing project under development by the Parallel And Reconfigurable Computing (PARC) group at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. PARCutils offers a set of parallel programming utilities, namely parallel iterator and RedLib (a reduction library), in a unified package.  For more information abobut the projects that are currently being studied by PARC group please visit our website at: http://parallel.auckland.ac.nz/ParallelIT/
